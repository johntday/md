## Coupon Features

The Coupon module generates and manages digital coupon codes for use within promotion rules.

This is   For more    the SAP Help  7 The Coupon module provides a range of features related to creating and managing coupon codes. For example, create singlecode and multi-code coupons to use in promotion rules. To dene the discount associated with a coupon, create a promotion rule. You can also create a promotion rule that, after checkout, gives the customer a free coupon for a later purchase.

Single-code Coupons A single-code coupon has only one code (for example, SUMMER_10 or BLACKFRIDAY). All customers who participate in the promotion use the same code. Multi-code Coupons Multi-code coupons consist of unique coupon codes, each of which can only be used one time, by one customer. Multicode coupons help ensure that only targeted customers can participate in a promotion.

Coupon Promotions When you create a coupon code, you must also create a promotion rule that denes the discount that customers receive when they redeem the coupon. You can also create a promotion rule that, after checkout, gives customers a free coupon for a discounted future purchase. Coupon Reporting Tools The Coupon module offers a downloadable report of redeemed coupons. You can also check whether a specic cart had a coupon applied to it.

## Single-Code Coupons

A single-code coupon has only one code (for example, SUMMER_10 or BLACKFRIDAY). All customers who participate in the promotion use the same code.

## Use Case

A customer can use a single-code coupon to participate in a promotional sale or to take advantage of a discount offer. The code is not unique to any specic customer, and can hence be shared. When you create the coupon, you decide whether each customer can redeem the coupon more than once. You can also set a limit on the number of total redemptions possible. Use a single-code coupon for promotions where you want as many customers as possible to participate.

## Features

Coupon Creation Create a single-code coupon that you can use in a promotion rule. Coupon Management Edit or delete existing coupons.

## Multi-Code Coupons

Multi-code coupons consist of unique coupon codes, each of which can only be used one time, by one customer. Multi-code coupons help ensure that only targeted customers can participate in a promotion.

## Use Case

A customer uses a multi-code coupon to participate in a promotional sale or to take advantage of a discount offer. The code is unique and can only be used one time. The customer cannot share the code or use it again on later carts. Here are some examples of multi-code coupons and their uses:

Customers receive a one-time coupon in an email when they abandon a shopping cart. The coupon prompts customers to complete the order. Customers get an email with a unique coupon code when they sign up for your newsletter. Using a unique code ensures that the customer can't use the code for later purchases. Customers occasionally contact your support team with a complaint about a product. To retain these customers, the support agent can provide them with a coupon code for 10% off a future order.

## Features

There is always a trade-off between security and performance. A strong setting can make it harder for the brute-force attacks but will increase resource consumption. So, it's up to your business scenario. In general, the bigger size of alphabet and the bigger product of the code part count and the code part length, therefore the stronger protection against brute force attacks. The more active the coupon codes you have, the less time it takes for a hacker to get the coupon codes.

When you create a coupon code, you must also create a promotion rule that denes the discount that customers receive when they redeem the coupon. You can also create a promotion rule that, after checkout, gives customers a free coupon for a discounted future purchase.

## Use Case

Customers redeem coupons to get a special discount on the storefront. Examples of coupon-based promotion rules include:
Customers can enter the single-code coupon WINTER20 at checkout to get 20% off their orders.

A customer can enter the multi-code coupon SALE-M80P-F6H3-R9N7 at checkout to get a free bonus product with the order.

## Features Coupon Promotion

You create coupons in the Coupons area. The coupon, however, is just a code. To assign a discount action to the coupon, you have to create a promotion rule. The promotion rule denes what happens when the customer enters the coupon during checkout. See Creating a Coupon Promotion. Free Coupon Giveaway Promotion The Free Coupon promotion action gives customers a free coupon during checkout. Customers can use the coupon for a future purchase. For example, if a customer spends ‚Ç¨500, after checkout the customer gets a coupon for ‚Ç¨50 off a future order.

## Creating A Coupon Promotion

Create a promotion rule that grants customers a discount when they redeem a coupon during checkout. The condition is the qualifying coupon, and the action is the applicable discount.

## Prerequisites

Create and activate a coupon in the Coupons area. Make sure that you understand the general directions for creating promotions. For more information, see Creating a Promotion Rule.

## Context

Use these instructions to create a promotion where one of the conditions of the promotion rule is a valid coupon. You can also set up a coupon promotion using the following templates:
Coupon code percentage discount Coupon code free gift with order threshold Coupon code percentage discount on products Coupon code xed discount

5. Expand the Coupon code condition. In the Qualifying coupons eld, select your coupon. 6. (Optional) Add additional conditions to the promotion rule. (For example, if the coupon grants customers a discount on specic products, add the Qualifying products or Qualifying categories condition to the promotion rule.)
7. In the Actions area, from the Available Actions menu, drag and drop the actions you want into the promotion rule. The action denes the discount that your customers receive when they redeem the coupon. Here are a few actions that would be appropriate for a coupon-based promotion rule:

Percentage discount on cart: When customers redeem the coupon, they get a percentage off the cart total. Example: 10% off the whole cart. Fixed discount on cart: When customers redeem the coupon, they get a xed discount off the cart total. Example: 20‚Ç¨ off the cart total. Percentage discount on products: When customers redeem the coupon, they get a percentage off of certain products (e.g., 20% off digital cameras). If you use this action, you also need to add a Qualifying products or Qualifying categories condition to the promotion rule. Fixed discount on products: When customers redeem the coupon, they get a xed discount off of certain products (e.g., 50‚Ç¨ off a camera lens). If you use this action, you also need to add a Qualifying products or Qualifying categories condition to the promotion rule.

## Coupon Implementation

Learn how to further implement and congure the Coupons module, as well as use the API for coupons. The Coupon module is delivered as part of the Promotion Engine and does not need to be installed separately. Use the data model and sequence diagrams available in this section to better understand how the coupons are implemented. In this section you can also learn how to migrate from vouchers (legacy functionality) to coupons. The Coupon module offers a web service to allow external systems to generate and administer coupons.

Coupons in Accelerator Coupons can help increase the conversion rate of your e-commerce site as well as reward your loyal customers. Coupon Web Services This is   For more    the SAP Help  27 The Coupon module offers a REST API web service to allow external systems to generate and administer coupons.

Data Model The Coupon Management Data Model provides you an overview of the interfaces included in the feature. Sequence Diagrams The Coupon Management Sequence Diagrams provide a representation of the Facades and Service Layer showing the actions from coupon redemption to validation, and to triggering promotions.

Migrate from Vouchers to Coupons To migrate from Vouchers to Coupons, you must manually create your vouchers as coupons. There is no automatic migration from Vouchers (Legacy) to Coupons.

## Coupons In Accelerator

Coupons can help increase the conversion rate of your e-commerce site as well as reward your loyal customers. Coupon management runs on top of the Promotion Engine, which offers exibility in creating various discounts or promotions. Unlike vouchers, which can only apply a discount amount on the cart subtotals, coupons use promotion rules created by the Promotion Engine. Promotion rules are applied to the cart itself, allowing for promotions that add a free gift or change the line items of a cart, as well as discounts on the cart subtotal.

## Prerequisites

Coupon implementation requires the Promotion Engine, which includes the required coupon management extensions. See Coupon Architecture to understand the dependencies between the various Promotion Engine extensions. Coupons must be activated and their corresponding promotion rules must be published in the Backoffice Administration Cockpit before they can be applied in the storefront. You can either use existing default coupons, or create new ones using templates. See Coupon Module for more details.

## Technical Overview

For the back end, the commercefacades extension was modied to use OrderAppliedVouchersPopulator to populate the list of applied coupons into the DTOs when reading cart or order data from the database. For the front end, two new JSP tag les were added and are referenced by three existing JSP tag les:

| New TAG Files   | Existing TAG Files   |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| yacceleratorstorefront/web/webroot/WEBINF/tags/responsive/cart/cartVoucher.tag                 | yacceleratorstorefront/web/webroot/WEBINF/views/responsive/pages/cart/cartTotalsDisplay.jsp                      |
| yacceleratorstorefront/web/webroot/WEBINF/tags/responsive/order/appliedVouchers.tag                 | yacceleratorstorefront/web/webroot/WEBINF/tags/responsive/checkout/multi/checkoutOrde yacceleratorstorefront/web/webroot/WEBINF/tags/responsive/checkout/multi/checkoutOrde                      |

The new JSP tag les were added to yacceleratorstorefront only; consequently, coupons are only supported for B2B
Accelerator and B2C Accelerator out-of-the-box. To implement coupons in other storefronts, you must add the two new JSP tag les and reference them in the existing tag les in a similar way. For an overview of the various interfaces used for coupons, see Data Model To gain understanding on the sequence of actions in the facades and service layer, see Sequence Diagrams

## User Experience

Users apply coupons to their orders in the checkout page. Coupons are applied by entering the case-sensitive coupon code in the Coupon Code field and then clicking the Apply button. The coupon is represented by a box with the coupon name below the Coupon Code field, and the discount amount is displayed in the order total section of the page. Users can remove the coupon by clicking the X in the coupon box.

This screenshot shows the WINTER16 coupon applied to a cart, giving a 10% discount on the order:

![28_image_0.png](28_image_0.png)

Once the order is placed with the applied coupon, the coupon code and discount amount is displayed in the order confirmation page, as well as the order details page, which is accessed through the user's order history. Note the following when using coupons:

- If a multi-code coupon is applied more than once, users are notified that the coupon code is invalid the second time users try to apply it to an order.

 If there are other promotions or coupons applied on the cart, the discount amount shows the combined discount of all

coupons and promotions.

 If a cart is saved with the coupon, the coupon is still applied to the cart when it is restored, provided that the promotion

for the coupon has not expired at the time when the cart is restored.

| 1       | Customer clicks CHECKOUT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2       | Storefront/Controller calls the DefaultCartFacade to validate the cart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3-4     | The call is forwarded to the DefaultCommerceCartService and the DefaultCartValidationStrategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5       | From within the DefaultCartValidationStrategy, the CouponRedeemableValidationHook.afterValidateCart hook is called.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6-8     | The hook loops over all applied coupon codes. The hook also calls the DefaultCouponService and the DefaultCouponManagementService to verify if the coupon codes are still valid and redeemable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 9-14    | When the current coupon code is valid and redeemable, the logic continues with checking the next coupon code. Otherwise, the invalid coupon code is removed from the cart and a cart recalculation is triggered (which includes re-evaluating the promotions, so that the invalid coupon's benets are also undone). In addition, a CommerceCartModification is created for the invalid coupon code and added to the list of CommerceCartModifications. |
| 15-18   | The list of CommerceCartModifications is returned. The standard functionality for handling or displaying validation errors ensures that the customer is notied and the checkout needs to be restarted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 2-3               | Before the order is placed, the cart is validated, which includes checking the applied coupon codes. See the Sequence Diagram for Starting Checkout for details about the cart/coupon validation.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4-5               | Depending on the result of the cart validation, either validation errors are displayed to the customer and the sequence ends or the placeOrder starts by calling the DefaultCheckoutFacade.placeOrder method.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 6-7               | The call is forwarded to the DefaultCommerceCheckoutService and the DefaultCommercePlaceOrderStrategy where the order is placed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 8                 | From within the DefaultCommercePlaceOrderStrategy, the CouponRedemptionMethodHook.afterPlaceOrder hook is called.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 9-11              | The hook loops over all coupons and calls DefaultCouponService and DefaultCouponManagementService to redeem the coupons. As part of the redemption process, the given coupon code is veried again.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 12-13             | Depending on the result of the coupon code verication, either a CouponRedemption item is created for valid coupon codes. Or, in case of an invalid coupon code, no redemption is created. As the order is already placed at this stage, no exception or error handling takes place, and invalid coupon codes are ignored. Basically, invalid coupon codes are not expected here any more. |
| 14-18             | Returns to the storefront and displays the order conrmation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
